# Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic snake game using Python 3.11 and the curses library. The game runs in the terminal and features a snake that grows when it eats fruits, and the game ends if the snake hits the border or itself.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11**: On Windows, this game has been tested and confirmed to run only on Python 3.11 or previous versions. It may not work as intended on later versions of Python.

## Installation

To play the game, ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your Windows system. If you need to install Python 3.11, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

## Usage

To start the game, clone this repository to your local machine and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash

python pysnake.py

Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Try to eat as many fruits as possible without running into the borders or yourself.

## Features

Simple and intuitive terminal-based UI
Adjustable game difficulty
Score tracking
